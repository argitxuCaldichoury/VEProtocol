Code repo for future publication: Contextual aversive conditioning protocol design in Humans â€“ a combination of behavioral and EEG measurements using immersive Virtual Reality. Argitxu Caldichoury, Luis Garcia-Larrea, Caroline Perchet, Maud Frot

The "Contextual conditioning protocol implemented in iVR" Word doc explains in detail the material used for the set up of the protocol, the creation of a  virtual environment in Unity and its experimental flow implementation using scripts coded in Visual Studio. 

Scripts are available in the "Unity scripts" folder. Their specific function are explained in the Word doc. 

The supplementary video illustrates an example of an experimental session. Specifically, it illustrates one tour around the apartment completed by a subject.  

Note: The Word Doc. and video files are too large to be visualised directly on github. The latter must be downloaded.
